# Designing for Accessibility: Best Practices for Inclusive Web Apps

Accessibility is about making your web applications usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. Here are some best practices to ensure your apps are inclusive.

## 1. Use Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<button>`, etc.) provide meaning and structure, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret your content.

## 2. Provide Text Alternatives

Always provide text alternatives for non-text content, such as images (`alt` attributes), icons, and media.

## 3. Ensure Sufficient Color Contrast

Text should have enough contrast with its background to be readable by users with low vision. Use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify.

## 4. Keyboard Navigation

Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and used with a keyboard. Avoid keyboard traps and provide visible focus indicators.

## 5. Use ARIA Landmarks and Roles

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes help convey additional information to assistive technologies. Use them to enhance, not replace, semantic HTML.

## 6. Test with Screen Readers

Test your app with screen readers (like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver) to ensure content is announced correctly and navigation is logical.

## 7. Avoid Auto-Playing Media

Auto-playing audio or video can be disruptive. Allow users to control playback.

## Conclusion

Designing for accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities. By following these best practices, you can create web applications that are more usable, inclusive, and successful.
