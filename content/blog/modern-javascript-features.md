# Modern JavaScript Features Every Developer Should Know

JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are added with each update to the language. Here are some of the most useful modern JavaScript features that every developer should know.

## 1. Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions:

~~~js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
~~~

## 2. Template Literals

Template literals make it easy to create strings with embedded expressions:

~~~js
const name = 'Alice';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
~~~

## 3. Destructuring Assignment

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into variables:

~~~js
const [a, b] = [1, 2];
const {x, y} = {x: 10, y: 20};
~~~

## 4. Default Parameters

You can set default values for function parameters:

~~~js
function greet(name = 'Guest') {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
~~~

## 5. Spread and Rest Operators

The spread operator (`...`) expands arrays or objects, while the rest operator collects multiple elements into an array:

~~~js
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4];

function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
~~~

## 6. Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing

Optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) make it easier to work with potentially undefined values:

~~~js
const user = {};
console.log(user.profile?.email ?? 'No email');
~~~

## Conclusion

Modern JavaScript features can make your code cleaner, more expressive, and easier to maintain. Stay up to date to take full advantage of what the language has to offer.
