## Fine-tuning Your Own Nutrition Expert LLM on MacBook Using MLX

**(Part 2: Model Training and Deployment)**

In Part 1, we learned how to prepare a fine-tuning dataset from a collection of nutrition books, chunk the content intelligently, and format it into a chat-style JSONL structure ready for model training.
Now in Part 2, we'll bring that dataset to life:
we'll fine-tune a pretrained instruct-tuned LLM (like Ministral-8B-Instruct) using Apple's MLX framework right on our MacBook.

By the end of this guide, we'll have a Nutrition Expert LLM, capable of answering dietary questions, suggesting recipes, and designing meal plans â€” all while running smoothly on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3).

### Step 1: Environment Setup (Recap)

Before starting training, ensure you have:
*   A MacBook with an M-series chip (M1, M2, M3 or later)
*   At least 16GB RAM (more preferred)
*   Python 3.10+ installed
*   Virtual environment ready (`python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`)
*   Libraries installed:

```bash
pip install -U mlx-lm pandas huggingface_hub
```

Also, make sure you've:
*   Logged into Hugging Face CLI (`huggingface-cli login`) if downloading models
*   Completed the dataset preparation (`train.jsonl`, `valid.jsonl`, and optionally `test.jsonl` are ready)

### Step 2: Choose Your Base Model

We need a small enough, instruction-tuned, quantized model that runs well on Mac.

For this tutorial, we'll use:

**Model:** `mlx-community/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit`

This is a 4-bit quantized version of Mistral 8B Instruct, ideal for Apple Silicon GPUs.
Download it if not already done:

```bash
huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit
```

Why this model?
*   8B parameter scale = detailed responses
*   4-bit quantization = fits into MacBook memory
*   Instruction-tuned = already good at Q&A interactions
*   MLX community optimized = fast Metal GPU support

You can scan your Hugging Face cache to check models:

```bash
huggingface-cli scan-cache
```

âœ… Once downloaded, you're ready to train.

### Step 3: Fine-tune Using `mlx_lm.lora`

Now, let's train with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) â€” a memory-efficient method that updates only a small subset of parameters.

**Basic Fine-tuning Command**

```bash
python3 -m mlx_lm.lora \
  --model mlx-community/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit \
  --data ./data \
  --train \
  --fine-tune-type lora \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --num-layers 16 \
  --iters 1000 \
  --adapter-path ./adapters \
  --mask-prompt
```

**Explanation of Parameters:**

| Parameter                       | Meaning                                                          |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``--model``                     | Hugging Face model repo or local path                            |
| ``--data``                      | Folder containing `train.jsonl` and `valid.jsonl`                |
| ``--train``                     | Activate training mode                                           |
| ``--fine-tune-type lora``       | Use LoRA instead of full fine-tuning                             |
| ``--batch-size 4``              | Mini-batch size (adjust if memory errors)                        |
| ``--num-layers 16``             | Apply LoRA to the final 16 transformer layers                    |
| ``--iters 1000``                | Number of training steps (iterations)                            |
| ``--adapter-path ./adapters``   | Folder to save LoRA weights                                      |
| ``--mask-prompt``               | Only compute loss on assistant responses (important!)            |

âš¡ Tip: If you hit memory limits, reduce `--batch-size` to 2 or 1.

### Step 4: Monitor Training

Once you run the fine-tuning command:
*   MLX will load the quantized model and the JSONL data
*   It will start updating LoRA adapters
*   You'll see logs with iteration numbers and training loss

You can monitor GPU usage separately:

```bash
sudo powermetrics --samplers gpu_power -i500 -n1
```

âœ… After around 15â€“30 minutes (depending on iterations and batch size), LoRA training should complete.
The adapter weights will be saved in the folder you specified (e.g., `./adapters/`).

### Step 5: Evaluate Fine-tuned Model

Now, let's test how well it learned!

Run evaluation with the test data:

```bash
python3 -m mlx_lm.lora \
  --model mlx-community/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit \
  --adapter-path ./adapters \
  --data ./data \
  --test
```

âœ… This reports the test loss and test perplexity.

A lower perplexity (~2.0 or lower) suggests good adaptation to nutrition Q&A tasks.

### Step 6: Try Out Your Fine-Tuned LLM

Want to manually talk to your new Nutrition Expert?

Use the `generate` command:

```bash
python3 -m mlx_lm.generate \
  --model mlx-community/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit \
  --adapter-path ./adapters \
  --max-tokens 400 \
  --prompt "Can you suggest a high-protein vegetarian breakfast?"
```

âœ… The fine-tuned model should now give focused, accurate nutrition advice based on the books we fed it!
Not random guesses like general LLMs.

### Step 7: (Optional but Recommended) Fuse Adapters

Right now, your model = base model + adapters.

If you want a standalone fine-tuned model, fuse the adapters:

```bash
python3 -m mlx_lm.fuse \
  --model mlx-community/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit \
  --adapter-path ./adapters \
  --save-path ./model/fine-tuned-nutritionist
```

âœ… Now `./model/fine-tuned-nutritionist/` contains your final model â€” no adapters needed anymore!

You can use it like this:

```bash
python3 -m mlx_lm.generate \
  --model ./model/fine-tuned-nutritionist \
  --max-tokens 400 \
  --prompt "Design a 1500-calorie meal plan rich in fiber."
```

### Step 8: What You Just Built

ðŸŽ¯ A nutrition-specialized LLM
ðŸŽ¯ Fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge extracted from trusted books
ðŸŽ¯ Running locally on a MacBook (no cloud GPU rental needed!)
ðŸŽ¯ Capable of deep, expert-level answers around food, diets, habits, and recipes

**Example outputs:**
*   "Here's a vegetarian high-protein breakfast: Greek yogurt parfait with chia seeds, berries, and almonds..."
*   "For a 1500-calorie high-fiber meal plan, include oatmeal breakfast, lentil salad lunch, roasted veggie dinner..."
*   "Fermented foods like kimchi and yogurt promote gut health by supplying beneficial probiotics..."

### Final Notes and Best Practices
*   If training fails due to memory: lower `--batch-size`, use gradient checkpointing (`--grad-checkpoint`), or reduce `--num-layers`.
*   Keep answers in dataset short enough to prevent exceeding token limits during training (~512â€“1024 tokens total).
*   Dataset quality is critical: better Q&A = better model!
*   You can export the fused model to GGUF format (for `llama.cpp` / CPU use) by adding `--export-gguf` to fuse command.
*   Upload your Nutrition LLM to Hugging Face using `--upload-repo your-username/fine-tuned-nutritionist` if you want to share.

ðŸš€ **Conclusion**

You just transformed a general-purpose LLM into a Nutrition Advisor, personalized to your exact knowledge sources â€” running entirely on a MacBook.
No cloud, no expensive GPUs, just smart local AI.

This shows how small fine-tuning projects can create massive value: you now have a domain expert AI to build apps, chatbots, advisors, or even publish!

In the future, you can extend this by:
*   Adding user preferences (e.g., gluten-free, keto, vegetarian plans)
*   Fine-tuning with more diverse data (nutrition courses, research papers)
*   Deploying the model in lightweight apps or API endpoints
